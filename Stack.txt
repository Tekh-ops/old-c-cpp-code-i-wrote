LIFO- last in, first out

To summarize the stack:

1.the stack grows and shrinks as functions push and pop local variables
2.there is no need to manage the memory yourself, variables are allocated and freed automatically
3.the stack has size limits
4.stack variables only exist while the function that created them, is running.
